# Challenge 2 Portfolio

## Alejandra Miret
As a bootcamp student, I want to have a portfolio that showcases my work to future employers. 

To accomplish this I had to first create my HTML to give my page structure, and then added CSS code to make my portfolio pleasing to look at, easy to navigate, accessible, and user friendly. 

## Usage
To use the webpage, enter url into search bar on browser, and a webpage portfolio titled Alejandra will render with content displaying an About Me, Work, and Contact Me Section. 

* When the user clicks on the header items, they are taken to their corresponding location. The resume anchor takes you to my resume. 
* When the user clicks on the email item in "Contact Me" section, a small window opens allowing the user to send an email to the displayed address.
* When the user clicks on the GitHub item in "Contact Me" section, they are taken to my GitHub Challenge-2 repository.
* When the user clicks on the LinkedIn item in "Contact Me" section, they are taken to my LinkedIn profile.
* When the user clicks on the pandora item in "Contact Me" section, they are taken to the Pandora music website.
